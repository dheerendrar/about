With over 6 years of software engineering experience, I've survived countless late-night coding sessions, 
dodged more bugs than I can count, and discovered that the secret to my productivity is an endless supply of coffee. 
My coding superpowers include PHP, JavaScript, Angular, Node.js, MySQL, and MongoDB. 
I'm here to bring a dash of humor to the tech world while building awesome stuff. 
Let's connect and swap coding war stories!
